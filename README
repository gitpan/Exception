README for Exception 1.00
=========================

This module is an attempt at a standardized methodology
for exception handling for Perl.  One of the issues
I've had to deal with when advocating Perl is it's lack of,
or strange looking exception handling mechanisim.  The
lack of exception objects was a recent thorn.  This module
attempts to provide a nice looking, feature rich exception
system.

Example
=======

use Exception qw(try catch throw);

try { throw(new Exception('Error.')); };
if(catch(qw(Exception e))) {
  print 'Caught: ',$e->as_string(),"\n";
}
elsif(catch()) {
  print 'Caught Unknown: ',$@,"\n";
}


Installation Notes
==================

The Exceptoin module compiles, tests, and installs just like
other standard Perl modules.

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the
PREFIX option when creating Makefile.PL.
