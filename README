Exception handling module for Perl

Copyright (c) 1999-2001 Horus Communications Ltd. All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself.

No dependencies, no XS code, so:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	man 3 Exception

is what you want to know.

Note that you may get a "panic: POPSTACK" error at the end of "make test"
if you are running Perl older than 5.6.0 - this is caused by a known bug
in Perl 5.005 that has been fixed for 5.6.0. I've left the module
dependency as "use 5.005" as this problem doesn't always show up, but if
you suffer from it, you should upgrade to 5.6.0 (which is a Good Thing
to do in any case).

Enjoy.
